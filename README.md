# 🚀 Backend Learning Journey

A personal learning repository documenting my journey to become a backend developer. This space contains projects, practice exercises, and notes as I build backend systems from the ground up.

> **Note:** Some technologies listed below (FastAPI, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL) are part of upcoming phases of this roadmap and will be introduced progressively as the learning path advances.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 📒 Notes
Theory, concepts, and cheatsheets organized by topic. Contains my personal documentation for backend concepts I'm learning.

### 🎮 Practice
Small exercises and course implementations:
- **CS50P**: Harvard's Python programming course exercises
- **Playground**: Experimental code and concept testing

### 🏗️ Projects
Complete backend projects with increasing complexity:
- **File Organizer**: CLI utility to organize files by type and date
- *More projects in development...*

## 🔧 Current Projects

### 🗂️ File Organizer
A Python CLI tool that organizes files in a directory by extension, date, or custom rules. Features include:
- File type categorization
- Date-based organization
- Custom rule support
- Batch processing

**Tech**: Python, Click CLI, pathlib

## 📚 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Python Fundamentals ✓
- Core Python syntax and data structures
- Object-oriented programming
- File I/O and system operations
- API integration basics

### Phase 2: Backend Development 🚧
- Web frameworks (FastAPI/Flask)
- Database design and ORM
- REST API architecture
- Authentication & security

### Phase 3: Production Ready 📅
- Containerization with Docker
- Testing and debugging
- Deployment strategies
- Performance optimization

## 📈 Progress Tracking

I maintain regular commits to track learning progress. Each project includes:
- Clean, documented code
- README with setup instructions
- Examples of usage
- Notes on challenges and solutions

## 🎯 Goals
- Build production-ready backend systems
- Master API design and database management
- Implement best practices in code and architecture
- Deploy scalable applications
